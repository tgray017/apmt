# APMT
The Awesome Project Management Tool (name to be changed at a time TBD) is an issue-tracking tool designed for scrum teams that allows product owners and scrum masters to create and edit tasks (aka "tickets") to be assigned to other users on their team. Tickets can be assigned to different statuses depending on where the assignee is in the process of completing the task, and tickets have due dates so it's easy to see which tickets should be done in what order. This application runs on Ruby 2.6.1.
